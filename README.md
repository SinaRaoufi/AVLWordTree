# AVLWordTree

In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

## Operations
Operation | Average | Worst Case
--- | --- | ---
Insert | O(log n) | O(log n)
Delete | O(log n) | O(log n)
Search | O(log n) | O(log n)
Search By Filters | O(n) | O(n)
Traversal | O(n) | O(n)
Clear | O(n) | O(n)
